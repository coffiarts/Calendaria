# Notes and Events

Calendar notes are journal entry pages that attach to specific dates. Notes support rich text content, custom icons, recurrence patterns, categories, and macro triggers.

## Note Storage

Notes are stored as individual `JournalEntry` documents within a dedicated folder per calendar. Each note contains a single `JournalEntryPage` of type `calendaria.calendarnote`.

Calendar infrastructure folders are hidden from the Journal sidebar to reduce clutter. Access notes through the calendar UI instead.

## Creating a Note

### From the Calendar UI

1. Click a date on the calendar grid
2. Click **Add Note** to open the note editor
3. Configure title, icon, dates, times, and content
4. Click **Save & Close**

### From the API

```javascript
await CALENDARIA.api.createNote({
  name: 'Council Meeting',
  content: "<p>Meeting with the Lords' Alliance</p>",
  startDate: { year: 1492, month: 5, day: 15, hour: 14, minute: 0 },
  allDay: false,
  categories: ['meeting']
});
```

## Recurrence Patterns

Set the **Repeat** dropdown to enable recurrence. Available patterns:

| Pattern       | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `never`       | One-time event (default)                  |
| `daily`       | Every N days                              |
| `weekly`      | Same weekday every N weeks                |
| `monthly`     | Same day of month every N months          |
| `yearly`      | Same month/day every N years              |
| `weekOfMonth` | Ordinal weekday (e.g., "2nd Tuesday")     |
| `seasonal`    | Based on season boundaries                |
| `moon`        | Based on moon phase conditions            |
| `random`      | Probability-based with seeded randomness  |
| `range`       | Pattern matching on year/month/day values |
| `linked`      | Relative to another note's occurrences    |
| `computed`    | Complex moveable feast calculations       |

### Repeat Options

- **Repeat Interval**: For `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, and `yearly` patterns, set how often the event repeats (e.g., every 2 weeks)
- **Max Occurrences**: Limits total recurrences (0 = unlimited)
- **Repeat End Date**: Stop repeating after this date

> [!NOTE]
> For monthless calendars (e.g., Traveller), the `monthly` and `weekOfMonth` patterns are hidden since they don't apply.

### Week of Month

Schedule events like "Second Tuesday of each month":

1. Set Repeat to **weekOfMonth**
2. Choose the occurrence (1st through 5th, or Last / 2nd Last)
3. Choose the weekday

### Seasonal

Events tied to seasons:

1. Set Repeat to **seasonal**
2. Select the season
3. Choose trigger: **Entire Season**, **First Day**, or **Last Day**

### Moon Phase

Events triggered by moon phases:

1. Set Repeat to **moon**
2. Add moon conditions by selecting a moon and phase
3. Optionally select a modifier to target a specific portion of the phase:
   - **Any**: Triggers during any part of the phase (default)
   - **Rising**: First third of the phase
   - **True**: Middle third of the phase
   - **Fading**: Last third of the phase
4. Multiple conditions can be added (any match triggers)

Moon conditions specify a phase range (0-1 position in cycle). The modifier label is shown in parentheses after the phase name (e.g., "Full Moon (Rising)").

### Random Events

Probability-based occurrence:

1. Set Repeat to **random**
2. Configure probability (0-100%)
3. Set check interval: daily, weekly, or monthly
4. Seed value ensures deterministic randomness across clients

Random occurrences are pre-generated and cached to ensure consistency.

### Linked Events

Events relative to another note:

1. Set Repeat to **linked**
2. Select the parent note
3. Set offset in days (negative = before, positive = after)

Example: "-3" offset creates an event 3 days before each occurrence of the linked event.

### Computed Events (Moveable Feasts)

Events that follow complex calculation rules, like Easter:

1. Set Repeat to **computed**
2. Configure a calculation chain with steps:
   - **Anchor**: Starting point (`springEquinox`, `autumnEquinox`, `summerSolstice`, `winterSolstice`, `seasonStart:N`, `seasonEnd:N`, `event:noteId`)
   - **First After**: Find first occurrence of a condition after the anchor (`moonPhase`, `weekday`)
   - **Days After**: Add a fixed number of days
   - **Weekday On Or After**: Find the next occurrence of a weekday on or after the current date
3. Optionally set year overrides for manual exceptions

Example chain for Easter: Spring Equinox -> First Full Moon After -> First Sunday After

### Range Pattern

Match dates using exact values, ranges, or wildcards:

1. Set Repeat to **range**
2. For each component (year, month, day), choose:
   - **Any**: Matches all values
   - **Exact**: Matches a specific value
   - **Range**: Matches a min-max range

### Advanced Conditions

Additional filters applied on top of recurrence patterns. All conditions must pass (AND logic).

Available condition fields:

| Category | Fields                                                                                          |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date     | year, month, day, dayOfYear, daysBeforeMonthEnd                                                 |
| Weekday  | weekday, weekNumberInMonth, inverseWeekNumber                                                   |
| Week     | weekInMonth, weekInYear, totalWeek, weeksBeforeMonthEnd, weeksBeforeYearEnd                     |
| Season   | season, seasonPercent, seasonDay, isLongestDay, isShortestDay, isSpringEquinox, isAutumnEquinox |
| Moon     | moonPhase, moonPhaseIndex, moonPhaseCountMonth, moonPhaseCountYear                              |
| Cycle    | cycle (if calendar has cycles)                                                                  |
| Era      | era, eraYear (if calendar has eras)                                                             |
| Other    | intercalary (for intercalary days)                                                              |

Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `%` (modulo)

The `%` (modulo) operator supports an optional offset for patterns like "every 3rd year starting from year 2".

## Categories

Predefined categories:

| ID         | Label    |
| ---------- | -------- |
| `holiday`  | Holiday  |
| `festival` | Festival |
| `quest`    | Quest    |
| `session`  | Session  |
| `combat`   | Combat   |
| `meeting`  | Meeting  |
| `birthday` | Birthday |
| `deadline` | Deadline |
| `reminder` | Reminder |
| `other`    | Other    |

### Custom Categories

1. Type a category name in the input field next to the multi-select
2. Click the + button to create
3. Right-click a custom category tag to delete it

Custom categories are stored in world settings and available to all notes.

### Category Style Confirmation

When adding a category to a note, a confirmation dialog appears offering to apply that category's icon and color to the note. The dialog previews the category's emblem and lets you accept or decline.

- Triggers each time a new category is added
- Detects the specific newly-added category rather than always using the first one
- Declining keeps the note's current icon and color unchanged

## Icons

Notes support two icon types:

- **FontAwesome**: Enter a class like `fas fa-dragon`
- **Image**: Select an image file via file picker

Right-click the icon picker to switch between modes. The icon color is controlled by the color picker.

## Visibility

- **GM Only**: Note is only visible to GMs (uses Foundry ownership system). This checkbox is only visible to GMs.
- **Silent**: Suppresses reminders and event announcements

Note visibility also respects Foundry's journal-level permissions. Non-GM users must have at least OBSERVER permission on the parent journal entry to see a note on the calendar and in search results.

## Reminders

Notes can trigger reminders before the event starts.

### Reminder Types

| Type     | Description           |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `none`   | No reminder           |
| `toast`  | UI notification popup |
| `chat`   | Message in chat log   |
| `dialog` | Modal dialog box      |

### Reminder Targets

| Target     | Description                |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| `all`      | All connected users        |
| `gm`       | Game Master only           |
| `author`   | Note creator only          |
| `specific` | Selected users from a list |

### Reminder Offset

Set how many minutes before the event the reminder should trigger. Set to 0 for reminders at event start time.

## Event Triggers

Notes can trigger actions when the event starts.

### Scene Activation

Select a scene to automatically activate when the event triggers. Useful for transitioning to specific locations at scheduled times.

### Playlist Playback

Select a playlist to start playing when the event triggers. Useful for ambient music or sound effects tied to in-game events.

### Macro Execution

Select a macro to execute when the event triggers. The macro runs when the event scheduler detects the event has started.

## Player Permissions

Players can create and edit notes based on Calendaria permissions. Ownership is determined by standard Foundry document permissions combined with the "Edit Notes" permission.

> [!NOTE]
> Players with the "Manage Notes" Calendaria permission but without Foundry's core `JOURNAL_CREATE` permission can still create notes. The request is relayed via socket to a connected GM who creates the note on their behalf.

### What Players Can Do

- **Create notes**: Using the Add Note button on calendar UI
- **Edit own notes**: Notes they created (Owner permission)
- **Edit others' notes**: If granted the "Edit Notes" permission (does not apply to GM-only notes)
- **Delete own notes**: Authors can delete notes they created
- **View shared notes**: Notes with appropriate permissions

### What Players Cannot Do

- **View GM-only notes**: Hidden via ownership settings
- **Delete others' notes**: Only the original author or a GM can delete
- **Modify time/date**: All time controls are GM-only
- **Change weather**: Weather picker is GM-only

### Note Ownership

When a player creates a note:

1. The JournalEntry is created with the player as owner
2. Users with the "Edit Notes" permission automatically receive owner-level access
3. Other players see it based on default permissions
4. GM always has full access

When a GM creates a note:

1. "GM Only" checkbox controls player visibility
2. If checked, ownership is set to GM-only (Edit Notes permission does not apply)
3. If unchecked, users with "Edit Notes" permission receive owner-level access

## For Developers
