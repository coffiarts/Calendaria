# HUD

The HUD displays date, time, weather, and events in a draggable widget. Two display modes are available: the full HUD with an animated dome (or slice), or a compact calendar view.

## HUD Mode

Configured via Settings > HUD tab:

| Mode       | Description                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `fullsize` | Animated sky view with sun/moon arc and info bar |
| `compact`  | Condensed bar with slice dial (no dome)          |

Double-click the HUD bar to toggle between fullsize and compact modes. Right-click the bar for a context menu with options:

- **Settings** - Opens the HUD settings tab
- **Show/Hide to All Players** - Toggle HUD visibility for all players (GM only)
- **Reset Position** - Reset HUD to default position
- **Lock/Unlock Position** - Toggle position locking
- **Switch to Compact/Fullsize** - Toggle between display modes
- **Close** - Close the HUD

## Dial Styles

The HUD supports two dial styles for displaying the sun/moon:

| Style   | Description                                                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dome`  | Semi-circular dome above the bar with sun/moon arc                |
| `slice` | Horizontal strip in the bar with sun/moon traveling left-to-right |

Configure via Settings > HUD tab > Dial Style.

### Combat Auto-Compact

When enabled, the HUD automatically switches to slice style during combat to reduce screen space usage. Configure via Settings > HUD tab > Compact During Combat.

### Hide During Combat

When enabled, the HUD hides entirely during combat and automatically reopens when combat ends. This takes precedence over Combat Auto-Compact. Configure via Settings > HUD tab > Hide During Combat.

## Full HUD

### Dome Display

The dome shows a dynamic sky that changes based on time of day:

- Sky gradient interpolates between 15 keyframes throughout the day
- Sun visible between sunrise and sunset; moon visible outside this range
- Stars fade in/out during twilight periods
- Clouds visible during daylight with fade-in/out transitions

**GM Only**: Click the dome to open the Time Dial for quick time adjustments.

**Players**: The dome is view-only and cannot be clicked.

### Non-Standard Time Support

The HUD fully supports calendars with non-standard time units:

- Time dial and hour markers automatically scale to `hoursPerDay`
- Sunrise/sunset positions calculated from calendar's daylight settings
- All time displays respect `minutesPerHour` and `secondsPerMinute`

### Time Dial (GM Only)

Click the dome or slice to open the Time Dial overlay:

- Drag the sun/moon around the arc to set time visually
- Time updates in real-time as you drag
- Release to confirm the new time
- Click outside or press Escape to cancel

### Slice Display

An alternative to the dome showing a horizontal sky strip:

- Sun/moon travels left-to-right across the bar
- Time displayed over the sky gradient
- Automatically used in compact mode

### Info Bar

The bar displays (left to right):

- **Search button** - Opens note search panel
- **Add Note button** - Creates a new note for today
- **Events** - Icons for today's notes (up to 5 displayed); click to open note
- **Date** - Click to open Set Date dialog (GM only)
- **Time** - Current time with play/pause button (GM only)
- **Weather** - Current weather; click to open weather picker (GM only). Shows "click to generate" prompt when no weather set.
- **Season** - Current season name and icon
- **Era** - Current era indicator (toggle via Show Era setting)
- **Cycle** - Current cycle value (toggle via Show Cycles setting)
- **Open Calendar** - Opens the BigCal Application (hidden if user lacks BigCal view permission)
- **Settings** - Opens the settings panel

### Block Visibility

Each indicator block (weather, season, era/cycle) can be hidden via Settings > HUD tab. Hiding blocks shrinks the HUD width automatically.

**Weather Display Modes:**

- Full (icon + label + temperature)
- Icon + Temperature
- Icon Only
- Temperature Only

**Season Display Modes:**

- Icon + Text
- Icon Only
- Text Only

Settings are user-scoped - each player can customize their view.

The tray can be configured to open upward or downward via Settings > HUD tab > Tray Open Direction.

> [!NOTE]
> Real-time clock speed is configured in Settings > Time tab, not on the HUD.

### Custom Time Jumps

Configure custom jump buttons (e.g., skip 8 hours) via Settings > HUD tab > Custom Time Jumps. Each increment type can have its own jump values for four buttons (two decrement, two increment). Leave blank to hide the button.

---

## Clock Sync

The real-time clock syncs with game state:

- **Pause Sync**: Clock stops when game is paused, resumes at 1:1 when unpaused
- **Combat Sync**: Clock stops during combat (time advances per-turn via system)

When sync is enabled and blocked (paused or in combat), manually starting the clock shows a warning notification.

> [!TIP]
> Hover over the HUD to reveal a pause button that stops the real-time clock without disabling the feature.

Configure sync behavior in Settings > Time tab.

---

## Search

Both HUD modes include a search panel:

- Type at least 2 characters to search note names and category names
- Use `category:` prefix to filter by category (e.g., `category:holiday`)
- Click a result to open the note
- Press **Escape** to close

---

## Positioning

### Dragging

- **Full HUD**: Drag the info bar
- **MiniCal**: Drag the top row (month/year header)

Position is saved per-client.

### Sticky Zones

Drag the HUD near predefined zones for automatic snapping:

| Zone             | Location                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `top-center`     | Centered at top of viewport |
| `above-hotbar`   | Above the macro hotbar      |
| `above-players`  | Above the players list      |
| `below-controls` | Below the scene controls    |

When dragging into a zone, the HUD wobbles to indicate snapping will occur. Release to snap into position.

**Mode Switching**: Position is preserved when switching between display modes (dome/slice/compact).

Toggle sticky zones via Settings > HUD tab > Enable Sticky Zones.

### Dome Visibility (Full HUD)

The dome automatically fades when approaching the top of the viewport and hides entirely if insufficient space. This auto-hide behavior can be disabled via Settings > HUD tab > Dome Auto-Hide.

### Locking Position

Enable "Lock Position" in settings to prevent dragging. Position can also be locked/unlocked via right-click context menu. Snapping to a sticky zone also locks position.

### Resetting Position

Settings > HUD tab (or MiniCal tab) > Reset Position

---

## Auto-Fade

When enabled, the HUD fades to a configurable opacity after the mouse leaves.

- Fade triggers after a brief delay when the mouse exits
- Hovering restores full opacity immediately
- Idle opacity configurable from 0% to 100%

Configure via Settings > HUD tab.

---

## Settings

Configure via **Settings Panel > HUD** tab. See [Settings](Settings#hud) for all options.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action                |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| Alt+C    | Toggle HUD visibility |
| Escape   | Close search panel    |

See [Keybinds](Keybinds) for all available keyboard shortcuts and configuration instructions.

---

## Player Permissions

Players have limited HUD interaction:

- **Can**: View date/time/weather, search notes, view non-GM notes, create notes
- **Cannot**: Open Set Date dialog, change time, change weather, access time controls

The dome and all time-related controls are non-interactive for players.

---

## Per-Scene Visibility

GMs can configure individual scenes to hide the HUD from players automatically. When a player navigates to a scene with "Hide HUD for Players" enabled, their HUD closes. When navigating to a non-hidden scene, the HUD is restored if they have "Show HUD on load" enabled.

Configure via **Scene Configuration > Ambiance tab > Hide HUD for Players**.
