### 3. Configure Applications

By default, the **MiniCal** appears on world load. Other applications are available:

- **HUD** — Floating HUD with animated sky dome
- **TimeKeeper** — Minimal time display and controls
- **BigCal** — Full calendar view via Journal footer or toolbar button

You can also access Calendaria apps via the **Journal footer button** or **toolbar button** (configurable in settings).

To configure which applications display:

1. Open the Settings Panel (gear icon on any Calendaria application)
2. Select the **HUD**, **MiniCal**, or **TimeKeeper** tab
3. Enable or disable the **Show** option for each application

> [!TIP]
> Use the keyboard shortcut **Alt+C** to quickly toggle HUD visibility. Additional keybinds for BigCal, MiniCal, and TimeKeeper are available but unbound by default—configure them in **Settings > Configure Controls > Calendaria**.
