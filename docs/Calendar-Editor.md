---

## Months Tab

Define your calendar's months.

### Month Fields

| Column            | Description                                                |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**          | Full month name (e.g., "January")                          |
| **Abbreviation**  | Short form (e.g., "Jan")                                   |
| **Days**          | Number of days in a normal year                            |
| **Leap**          | Extra days added during leap years                         |

| **Type**          | Standard or Intercalary                                    |

### Month Types

- **Standard** — A normal month that is part of the regular calendar structure
- **Intercalary** — Days that exist outside the normal month/week structure (e.g., festival days between months, the "Day of Threshold" in Renescara). Intercalary periods typically don't count toward normal weekday progression.

### Month Controls

- **Custom Weekdays** (calendar-week icon) — Toggle custom weekday names for this month only
- **Add** (+) — Insert a new month after this one
- **Move Up/Down** (chevrons) — Reorder months
- **Remove** (trash icon) — Delete this month

### Custom Weekdays Per Month

When enabled, a month can have its own weekday names independent of the global weekdays. Useful for intercalary periods or months with special day naming.

### Zero-Day Months

Months can have 0 days in their base configuration, making them only appear during leap years when extra days are added. Useful for leap-year-only festival periods.

- Navigation automatically skips 0-day months in non-leap years
- Year view displays 0-day months with reduced opacity

## Weekdays Tab

Configure the days of the week and optional named weeks.

### Weekdays List

| Column           | Description                                                                       |

## Time Tab

Set how time works in your world, including daylight and date formatting.

### Time Structure

- **Days Per Year** — Calculated automatically from month definitions; displays normal and leap year totals if different
- **Hours Per Day** — Number of hours in one day (default: 24)
- **Minutes Per Hour** — Number of minutes per hour (default: 60)
- **Seconds Per Minute** — Number of seconds per minute (default: 60)
- **Seconds Per Round** — Combat round duration in seconds (default: 6)

> [!WARNING]
> Changing time settings affects how Foundry's world time is interpreted. Existing timestamps may display differently.

### Non-Standard Time Units

Calendaria fully supports calendars with non-standard time structures:

- **Variable hours per day** — Calendars can have any number of hours (e.g., 20-hour days)
- **Variable minutes per hour** — Calendars can have any number of minutes (e.g., 100 minutes/hour)
- **Variable seconds per minute** — Calendars can have any number of seconds

When using non-standard time:

- AM/PM midday is calculated as `hoursPerDay / 2` instead of fixed 12
- Time dial and hour markers automatically scale to the configured hours
- All API time methods respect the calendar's time structure
- Sunrise/sunset calculations adapt to the day length

### Daylight Configuration

Control sunrise and sunset times throughout the year.

- **Enabled** — Toggle daylight calculations on/off
- **Shortest Day** — Hours of daylight on the winter solstice
- **Longest Day** — Hours of daylight on the summer solstice
- **Winter Solstice** — Month and day of the shortest day
- **Summer Solstice** — Month and day of the longest day

Calendaria interpolates daylight hours between these solstices using a sinusoidal curve.

### AM/PM Notation

Customize 12-hour time labels for your setting.

- **AM Notation** — Text for morning hours (default: "AM")
- **PM Notation** — Text for afternoon/evening hours (default: "PM")

Examples: "Sunward" / "Moonward", "Before Noon" / "After Noon"

### Canonical Hours

| **Abbreviation** | Short form                     |
| **Start Hour**   | When this period begins (0-23) |
| **End Hour**     | When this period ends (0-23)   |

### Date Formats

Customize how dates and times display using template variables.

| Format               | Purpose                           | Example Output                  |

## Saving Your Calendar

Click **Save Changes** to store your calendar. Options:

The **Delete** button behavior depends on the calendar type:

- **Custom calendars** — Permanently deletes the calendar
- **Bundled calendars with overrides** — Resets to the original bundled version
- **Bundled calendars without overrides** — Cannot be deleted

> [!NOTE]
> You must save a new calendar before the Delete button becomes available.

### Reset Button

The **Reset** button clears all current editor data and starts with a blank calendar template. This does not affect saved calendars.

## Tips

- Start with a bundled calendar close to what you need, then customize
- Use the **Renescara** calendar as a reference for advanced features
- Test your calendar before using it in a live game
